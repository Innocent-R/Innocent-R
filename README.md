## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Innocent

I hold a degree in management with a concentration in logistics and operations, culminating in a capstone project aimed at enhancing public transport in my home country of Rwanda. After graduation, I realized that many challenges could be addressed more effectively through technology, which inspired my transition into software engineering. I now focus on building innovative solutions that create meaningful impact for my community. In 2024, I moved to the U.S. to pursue this dream, embracing the countryâ€™s opportunities for growth and learning. If youâ€™re seeking a software engineer passionate about creating technology that improves everyday life, Iâ€™m excited to contribute.
