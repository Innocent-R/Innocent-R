## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Innocent
From a childhood spent destroying radios to see if I can find people inside, to running a business in college with a keen focus on tech, my journey has always been driven by curiosity and a passion for technology. I came to the US with the dream of turning my tech skills into a full-fledged career, believing in the opportunities for growth and support here. Thanks to my strong teamwork and problem-solving abilities, I was enrolled into the Resilient Coders software engineering bootcamp . Now, I'm on a mission to become a Full Stack Developer, creating innovative solutions that make an impact in the community.
