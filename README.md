## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Innocent

From a childhood spent destroying radios to find out what's inside, to running a business in college with a keen focus on tech, my journey has always been driven by curiosity and a passion for technology. 

Having a dream of turning my tech skills into a full-fledged career, I was enrolled into the Resilient Coders software engineering bootcamp . 

Now, I'm on a mission to become a Full Stack Developer, creating innovative solutions that make an impact in the community.
